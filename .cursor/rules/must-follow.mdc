**IMPORTANT: These rules are MANDATORY. You MUST follow every rule listed here without exception.**

- NEVER use forwardRef. This is not needed in React 19
- ALWAYS use @ui Text component for rendering regular text.
- NEVER use default tailwind colors. Use the ones defined in our globals.css
- ALWAYS use Type over Interface.
- ALWAYS use zod for parsing/validation. Do not manually JSON.parse
